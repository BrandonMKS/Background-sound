# Background-sound
 Basically this program makes it so that there is constantly some sort of sound running on my computer, which probably isnt useful for most people.
 I created this purely for my own benefit because my laptop has an issue that causes the audio to sometimes not function if there was not something continuously playing.
 For example: I'm watching youtube and I switch to a different video. There is a moment where there is no active audio. Then when the next video is supposed to start playing it does not work.
 Instead it is frozen until I click mute, but anytime I unmute it it freezes again, and the audio is completely disfunctional for every other program or app on my laptop.
 I gave youtube as an example, but it can happen with any website, any game, any program in general, which is annoying, and the only fix is restarting it. Also it doesn't happen every 5 hours or something.
 It seems random, sometimes it can last hours without this problem, other times it happens within 5 minutes, and I don't know whats causing it, and I have searched it up, but haven't found anyone else with the exact issue.
 The issue only came up about a year after owning my laptop, and I've factory reset it to no avail. No updates have fixed it and I've also reinstalled every audio-related driver but once again, no fix. CPU is a AMD Ryzen 7 7745HX with Radeon Graphics 3.7 GHz.
 The GPU is the RTX 4070 Laptop GPU, and it's a Lenovo Legion 5, so if anyone happens to know the fix, I would greatly appreciate it. 
 
 
 Anyways, this program basically just plays white noise on loop at a very quiet volume just so it keeps the audio on all the time, to prevent my issue. I have it set so it's a startup app.
